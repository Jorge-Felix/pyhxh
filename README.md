# pyhxh V1.5
a novice program that contains package capturing, ddos, fake identity creator, ipinfo api,
directory explorer and port scan.
more features will be added in future versions therefore keep cheeking the project,
it is worth to know that this project is being made by a begginer in CiberSecurity even tho it does not mean that this program
is slow or trashy, actually it is pretty fast having in mind that it being coded in python and bash (being mostly coded in python).

thx for reading and cheeking out my project.
